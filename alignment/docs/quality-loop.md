# Quality loop — review log for alignment/

Recurring agent review (engineering quality + product-surface language).
Each entry: date, reviewed SHA, findings, fixes applied. The loop skips
ticks with no new commits past `last-reviewed`.

last-reviewed: fef74cd

## 2026-07-17 — bootstrap (reviewed SHA: 8fb61ca)

This entry records the baseline rather than a new review: 8fb61ca is
itself the application of a full dual-agent review of the whole package
(reports in docs/reviews/2026-07-17-engineering-review.md and
2026-07-17-language-audit.md — 10+10 Tier-1 items, ~50 Tier-2 items, all
applied; 85 tests green; JS syntax-checked; vocabulary purge verified).
No new agent dispatched this tick — the tip commit is the reviewed state.

Open backlog carried forward (not yet applied anywhere): none — both
review Tier-2 lists were applied in 8fb61ca. Future findings accumulate
here.

## 2026-07-18 — tick over 8fb61ca..fef74cd (agent stalled; completed by hand)

Review agent applied Tier-1 polish before a watchdog stall: mirror.py —
pluralization helper ("1 promise" not "promise(s)"), "worst" red-flag now
means worst (contradiction outranks partial regardless of order),
NO_MATERIAL_IMPACT comparison via enum value; mirror.html — consistent
CONTRADICTED casing, verdict_display in the human-queue, obligation id
escaped; propose.py — extract_doc_paths simplified (char class already
excludes quoting chars). Verified after the stall: 92 tests green, all
three pages' JS syntax-checked. Backlog surfaced before stalling: none
logged. Known follow-up (next tick): mirror.html duplicates esc() a third
time — extract shared static/app.js.
